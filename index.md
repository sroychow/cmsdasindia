# CMS DAS Pre-Exercises

These exercises cover the basic software skills you will need for the CMS Data Analysis school. The material of these pre-exercises have been taken from a series of lectures and tutorials aimed for India-CMS students over the period of February to June 2025. The links to all the lectures and the recordings are available on this indico [page](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1553817/).

All students should aim to complete the pre-exercises with the same laptop they'll use during the school. The goal is to setup your computing environment ahead of time, so you can dive into the real material on day one of CMSDAS. Advanced participants (i.e., those who have spent time on LHC experiments already) may not need to complete the pre-exercises as thoroughly, but please do read through everything to make sure everything works (e.g., accounts, certificates, and environments).

**Requirements**: Participants must have access to a computer with internet access. They should have an computing account at CERN/TIFR.

**How to approach the exercise?**: For each topic, the particpants are required to go through the lectures linked from the indico page and listen to the recordings. Specific instructions for each topic will be provided below.

**Submission of answers**: After completing the lectures, you are asked to fill out a google form with answers to specific problems. Link to the form is provided at the end of the page.

## Topic 1: Introduction to Linux and bash programming

Follow the three part lecture from this [link](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1553817/#b-622142-linux-commands-and-ba). The first two lectures introduces basic Linux commands you shall need, while the third lecture introduces bash programming. After completing these lectures, you shall be able to answer Questions 1 & 2 from the exercise.

## Topic 2: Obtain a Grid Certificate and CMS VO Registration

A Grid Certificate and CMS VO registration will be needed for the DAS school. There are two main requirements which can be simply summarized: A certificate ensures that you are who you claim to be. A registration in the VO recognizes you (identified by your certificate) as a member of CMS. Follow the instructions in this [twiki](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideLcgAccess#Getting_a_personal_certificate) to obtain a personal certificate. Then, install the certificate on lxplus/tifr following the [twiki](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookStartingGrid#ObtainingCert). If the certificate installation is successful, test the installation by executing the command _ voms-proxy-init --rfc --voms cms_.

*Advanced participants (i.e., those who have spent time on CMS experiment already) may skip this step if they have done it.
